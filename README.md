# My Zed Settings

This README describes my personal settings and key bindings for the Zed editor.

## Keymap

The `zed/keymap.json` file contains custom key bindings to enhance productivity. Some notable bindings include:

- Vim-like pane navigation using `ctrl-w` followed by `h`, `j`, `k`, or `l`.
- Shortcuts for formatting code and toggling comments.
- Efficient shortcuts for managing projects and tabs.

## Settings

The `zed/settings.json` file includes configurations to tailor the Zed editor to my preferences. Key highlights include:

- Vim mode is enabled for efficient text editing.
- The editor uses the Gruvbox theme, switching between light and dark modes based on the system setting.
- Custom fonts are set for both the UI and the editor buffer.

## Conclusion

These settings and key bindings help me work efficiently in the Zed editor. Feel free to explore and adapt these configurations to suit your workflow!
